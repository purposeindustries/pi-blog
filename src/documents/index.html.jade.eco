      h1 Purpose 
        span Industries
      p We are a team of 4. United to build products with the aim to enrich people’s lives. Our backgrounds are diverse and complementary. We embrace constant change as a fundamental rule of nature and adapt to it with continuous learning and iterations. By doing so can we achieve higher levels of mastery within our chosen crafts. To us magic unfolds when human mastery meets human collaboration.
      p So this is the principle. And where do we stand today? At step #0.1. We are building our first product and set the fundaments. There is a lot to learn and to iterate. Trying to consciously enjoy the journey.

        p.bio Building products has been my obsession ever since. I settled with Javascript as my primary medium to build products people love! To me impossible is not an option but an erroneous belief. Take that!

        p.bio I first met with an alien in 1999. It was on a beautiful summer night in my bedroom. After this everything changed. I fell in love with the blank canvas. Now I'm working on the Fukushima Cleansing Program with the Great White Brotherhood.
